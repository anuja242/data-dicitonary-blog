In this blog post we will start learning Data Dictionary part.

**What is Data Dictionary?**

Data dictionary is the central repository where we can create and maintained data definition (Metadata). Metadata is data about data.
Data dictionary store data definition of user define types (Data Elements, Structures and Table Type). Also, we can create and maintained the database objects like tables, views and index.
**User Define Types**

**1.	Data Elements**

**2.	Structure**

It is a collection of components.

**3.	Table Type**

Table type describe the structure and functional attributes of an internal table in ABAP programming.

**Database Objects**

**1.	Tables**

**2.	Views**

View is created by combining the data from one or more tables. It is a virtual table that doesnâ€™t exist in any physical location.

**3.	Index**

It enables the faster access to row in the table.

**Domain**

It contains the technical properties like data type and length. It is assigned to data element.

**Lock Objects**

These are used to synchronize access to the same data by one or more user.

**Search Helps**

These are objects which assigned to screen fields for providing input help. 
Here we have completed the introduction of Data Dictionary. We will learn how to create all these objects and how to use it in coming blog post.
